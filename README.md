### Problem statement:

Design a system in ReactJS which can load geometric shapes based on a configuration. The component should support below features
The system should only take a configuration to decide which shape to render. No React elements can be passed as children to render a shape, the system should decide which component to render.
Each Shape should be a standalone component
It should be easy to add support for new geometric shapes. Like a plugin system, any new shape can be supported with just a configuration change and addition of a new component to the library.
The system can initially support these shapes Circle , Square, Rectangle ,Hexagon.

### Expectation:

Detailed code is not required however an explanation of the model that will support the design is expected.
You can write pseudo code and describe your approach in comments.
